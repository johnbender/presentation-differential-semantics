* Semantic Deficiency
** intent vs code
*** optimizations
*** error messages
*** bug finding
*** declarative langs.
** sources of semantics
*** syntax
*** tests
*** types
*** execution
** isolated view
*** single version
*** programs evolve
*** state evolves
* Semantics for Diffs
** high level
*** meaning of patches
*** correctness of patches
*** migration of system state
** sql ddl
*** table declarations
*** alter statements
*** goal: idempotent
*** complexity growth
*** reduction with diffs
** config mgmt
*** similar to DDL
*** less declarative
*** package install removal
** dynamic software update
*** adapter synthesis
